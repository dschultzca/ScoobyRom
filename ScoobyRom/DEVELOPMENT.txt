1) Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
========================================

*)	MonoDevelop
http://monodevelop.com/
This one is ideal because it has a good Gtk# user interface designer - saves time.
Multi-platform, tested on Linux and Windows.

*)	Visual Studio 2010
Confirmed working.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/
Free express versions: http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads
Obviously Windows only, has no Gtk# designer but can compile own + generated Gtk# code.
VS uses msbuild under the hood.


2) Compiling from source without IDE
====================================

2.1) Mono (Linux)
*****************
Mono provides xbuild command line tool.
Corresponding Linux package might be called "mono-dev" or "mono-devel".

xbuild /property:Configuration=Release ScoobyRom.sln

or

xbuild /property:Configuration=Debug ScoobyRom.sln

or just "xbuild" (defaults to Debug build)


2.2) Windows
************
Like on Linux, just replace "xbuild" with "msbuild".
You might need to specify exact path of msbuild.exe.

msbuild /property:Configuration=Release ScoobyRom.sln


3) Misc Commments
=================
Created on Linux using free open source software!

.) .NET version
Currently the code needs a .NET 4.0 compatible runtime (Windows .NET, Mono etc.)
Backporting code and solution/project files to VS 2008 and .NET 3.5 for example is certainly possible.
Currently there's little code making use of .NET 4.0 features ("Task" is one).

.) Creatibg multi-platform assemblies
Personally I use .NET on Windows to compile the public binaries as these are multi-platform by default.
Meaning the EXE runs on both Windows & Linux at least.
Pretty good feature If you ask me - compile once, copy and run everywhere.
(Mono on Linux overrides Windows Gtk+ library names stored inside the binaries etc. but not the other way?)

.) Assembly Signing
Might help for Windows OS security, not entirely sure yet.
Used my own key, not included of course.

.) Code Formatting
MonoDevelop "Format Document" has been used. It's not perfect, can make bad long lines.

.) Code
The main author still considers this software experimental!
It wasn't clear what features would work upfront, with as little effort as possible.
Currently there's no unit testing in here, no solid abstraction, code does not follow patterns,
namespace hierarchy is messy etc.
